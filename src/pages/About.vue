          When I‚Äôm not wielding my camera capturing moments of my own kids, I
          can be found sipping iced coffee (I vacillate between iced mochas and
          iced miels). Or I could be petting one of two household cats üòÄ If you
          know personality type stuff, I‚Äôm an ENFP (Myers-Briggs) and a 4w3
          (Enneagram), which basically means I‚Äôm bursting with color,
          creativity, emotion, & expression‚Ä¶ which all work in your favor to get
          personality-packed photos!

            Of course you are! You‚Äôre busy! Stuff like this gets put on the
            backburner, because there are more important things right in front
            of you‚Ä¶ like relationships, your kids‚Äô needs, your grocery list,
            your 78 loads of laundry, etc!

            Not to mention, you‚Äôve done this before-- booked a photographer,
            paid the money, gotten the kids looking adorable for the session,
            only to have them misbehave during pictures & only end up with a
            couple of pictures you actually like. Which you now have to spend
            MORE time & money on in order to get prints made to display in your
            home.
